"""YAML-based filter pack engine for Shrike.

Evaluates keep/drop rules against classified log events.
This is Stage 3 of the Shrike pipeline — runs in <1ms per evaluation.

Filter packs are YAML files with ordered rules. First match wins.

Example:
    name: PCI-DSS
    rules:
      - keep: {classes: [3002, 3003, 3005, 4001, 4007]}
      - keep: {severity_id: {gte: 3}}
      - drop: {classes: [0]}
      - keep: all
